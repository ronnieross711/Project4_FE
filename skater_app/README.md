This is an app for skate board fans. You have the ability to create and delete professional skate boarders. The point of this site is to make a database of all of the pro skate boarders in the world.

I want to add a video to the main page that plays when people land on the site.
I also want to add a create account functionality and a log in functionality as well. Right now I have the buttons but no functionality.
